# Q-system

Problem Statement:
Due to covid-19 , District Administrator of Cachar Assam has setup a Quarantine Facility at NIT Silchar which can accommodate a maximum of 500 people. A fixed number of passengers from Silchar airport are directed to NIT Silchar Quarantine Facility. Quarantine time period is 14 days, after which the patient has to be discharged. 

Each patient is to be allotted a single room, its distribution should be as follows :-
i) Ground Floor – for 60 yrs and above age. Total rooms = 200 
ii) First Floor – for between 40 and 60 yrs of age Total rooms = 150 
iii) Second Floor – for age below 40 yrs Total rooms = 150 

The Nodal Officer who administers the Q-centre has to keep tract of the records of the patients like name ,age ,address ,arrival date ,coming from ,going to ,allotted room ,discharge date ,etc . Thus a piece of code/software to be designed so that the record of the quarantined person can be store properly.
